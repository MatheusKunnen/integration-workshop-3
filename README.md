## Overview

A frequent concern of parents is the difficulty in controlling their children's eating habits at school, as children need healthy snacks to support their growth and development. Unfortunately, many of the snacks provided in the school canteen are high in fat, sugar and salt. Furthermore, it is difficult to guarantee that children diagnosed with food allergies or intolerance do not eat foods containing ingredients that may cause a reaction. On top of that, kids might not know how to manage their money well and end up spending too much.

The project tries to solve these problems with a system that allows parents to manage the options of snacks shown to their kids, and a vending machine to distribute these snacks.

The mobile application allows parents to register their children in the system, select the specific snacks that will be available for them to buy and specify their daily budget. The vending machine identifies the child and shows all available authorized food options along with the available budget. Finally, when the desired product is selected, the machine asks for confirmation and then delivers the snack.

## Acknowledgements

The team would like to express their deepest gratitude to Professor Dr. Heitor Silvério Lopes and Professor Dr. João Alberto Fabro for their guidance and support during the development of the project. Also, the team is thankful to all the professors of Computer Engineering at UTFPR for their contributions to the team members academic growth. Their collective efforts in imparting knowledge and sharing experiences were fundamental to the development of capabilities that made this a successful project.
